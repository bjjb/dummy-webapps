Dummy Web Applications
======================

This repository contains some boiler-plate web applications that I like to
keep around for testing, and whatnot.

The apps are on branches:

- [rails2] is a Ruby (1.8.7) on Rails (2.3.14) app, ActiveRecord and SQLite3
- [rails3] is a Ruby (1.9.3) on Rails (3.2.13) app, ActiveRecord and SQLite3
- [rails4] is a Ruby (2.1.0) on Rails (4.0.1) app, ActiveRecord and SQlite3
- [sinatra] is a Sinatra (1.4.4) app using MongoDB
- [activerecord] is a mini-app using ActiveRecord (4.0.2), Rack and SQLite3
- [express] is an ExpressJS app using MongoDB
